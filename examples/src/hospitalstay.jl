# ## Length of hospital stay

# Below we look at data on length of hospital stay for patients
# undergoing a cardiovascular procedure.  This example illustrates how
# the variance function can be changed to a non-standard form.  Modeling
# the variance as Î¼^p for 1<=p<=2 gives a Tweedie model, and when p=1 or
# p=2 we have a Poisson or a Gamma model, respectively.  For 1<p<2, the
# inference is via quasi-likelihood as the score equations solved by GEE
# do not correspond to the score function of the log-likelihood of the
# data (even when there is no dependence within clusters).  In this
# example, as is often the case, the parameter estimates and standard
# errors are not strongly sensitive to the variance model.
